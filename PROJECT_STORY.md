# FindAThon Prime: The Journey of Building an Autonomous Hackathon Discovery Engine

## Inspiration

As developers, we've all been there‚Äîscrolling through endless websites, checking DevPost, HackerEarth, and countless university portals, desperately trying to find hackathons that match our interests. We'd bookmark sites, set manual reminders, and still miss amazing opportunities because we forgot to check that one obscure platform. 

The breaking point came when we realized we'd missed a $100K AI hackathon simply because it was hosted on a platform we'd never heard of. That's when we asked ourselves: "What if AI could do this tedious discovery work for us?" But not just scraping‚Äîwhat if it could actually *understand* websites and adapt to any platform automatically?

Thus, FindAThon Prime was born‚Äîthe world's first autonomous hackathon discovery engine that doesn't just find opportunities, but evolves with the web itself.

## What it does

FindAThon Prime is a multi-agent AI system that revolutionizes how developers discover hackathons. Here's the magic:

**Autonomous Discovery**: Tell it "find hackathons on any-new-site.com" and watch it work. It analyzes the website structure, searches for APIs, and if none exist, generates custom Python scrapers in real-time.

**Self-Learning**: Every tool it creates is saved and reused. The system builds an ever-growing library of discovery methods, becoming smarter with each new platform.

**Intelligent Notifications**: The Nudge Agent learns your preferences and proactively alerts you to relevant opportunities. No more manual checking‚Äîit comes to you.

**Real-Time Updates**: Through Telegram integration, you get live progress updates as the Scout Agent works, making the discovery process transparent and engaging.

**Enterprise-Grade**: Built on AWS with serverless architecture, it scales from individual developers to enterprise teams handling millions of users.

## How we built it

**Architecture**: We designed a three-brain system:
- **Scout Agent** (Claude Sonnet + ECS Fargate): Handles complex discovery and tool generation
- **Nudge Agent** (Claude Haiku + Lambda): Manages intelligent notifications
- **Knowledge Base** (Bedrock KB + OpenSearch): Provides trusted source grounding

**Tech Stack**:
- **AWS Bedrock**: Claude 3 models for natural language processing
- **ECS Fargate**: Containerized Scout Agent for resource-intensive tasks
- **Lambda**: Lightweight Nudge Agent and Telegram webhook handling
- **DynamoDB**: Hackathon data and generated scraper storage
- **OpenSearch Serverless**: User preferences and vector similarity matching
- **Strands Framework**: Conversational AI agents with 40+ pre-built tools

**Key Innovation**: The autonomous tool generation workflow that can reverse-engineer any website and create custom extraction tools without human intervention.

## Challenges we ran into

**1. Strands mem0 Tool Integration Crisis**
The biggest technical hurdle was discovering that Strands' `mem0_memory` tool doesn't properly integrate with AWS Bedrock models. The tool expected OpenAI-compatible responses but received different formats from Claude, causing JSON parsing failures and memory corruption.

*Solution*: We built a custom `mem0_json_memory` wrapper with multiple fallback strategies for JSON extraction, including regex patterns and validation loops.

**2. OpenSearch Serverless Security Maze**
AWS OpenSearch Serverless has complex security policies that must be created in a specific order. We spent hours debugging CloudFormation failures due to policy dependencies and readonly property constraints.

*Solution*: Carefully orchestrated security policy creation with proper dependency management and hardcoded resource references where dynamic ones failed.

**3. CloudFormation Template Complexity**
Managing 15+ AWS services in a single template with proper IAM permissions, VPC networking, and resource dependencies became a deployment nightmare.

*Solution*: Built a comprehensive deployment script that handles Docker builds, ECR pushes, Lambda updates, and parameter validation in one command.

**4. Real-Time Progress Streaming**
Users needed to see the Scout Agent's progress in real-time, but ECS Fargate containers can't directly communicate with Telegram.

*Solution*: Implemented an SQS-based messaging system where the Scout Agent sends progress updates to a queue, which triggers Lambda functions to forward messages to users.

**5. Dynamic Code Execution Security**
Allowing AI-generated Python code to execute in production required careful sandboxing and security measures.

*Solution*: Isolated execution environments with restricted imports, comprehensive logging, and containerized execution boundaries.
